# Running the program
If you just want to run the program and simply ignore what comes next, just look at this section. <br>
All you need to do is make sure the font file (misaki_gothic_2nd.ttf), player list (players.csv), and <br>
the img directory are in the same directory as the GWBaseball2024.exe. <br>
If you are too lazy, you may just simply copy and paste the files found in this directory into the one before <br>
(assuming that you cloned this repository to your system).

# Install
This could probably be the toughest part... <br>
There are several ways of installing the SFML library for Windows but I prefer the way using Visual Studio. <br>
As long as you follow the instructions found in this video, the code should work. <br>
You can name the project as "GWBaseball2024" or something. 

# File and folder setup
Copy and paste the files found in this directory into the Visual Studio project you made. <br>
Also don't forget to add the font file (misaki_gothic_2nd.ttf), player list (players.csv), and <br>
the img directory into the project directory.

# Running the code
Simply pressing F5 on the keyboard while in Visual Studio should make it work.
