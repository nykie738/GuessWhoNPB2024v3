# Compatibility
The code works as intended on the following OS: MacOS, Ubuntu/Linux, and Windows. <br>
Copy and paste the files in the OS directory depending on the OS you are going to run the code on. <br>
The instructions and codes to type in terminal are found in the README.md in each OS directory.

# Note
I only made the keyboard input compatible to English so please be careful with the keyboard language settings. <br>
This is important especially for macOS users. Believe it or not, you have to have the settings on either British English or US Engish. <br>
The images used for this game is implemented through Depth Anything V2. <br>
Their program is actually amazing! I highly recommend people to try out their work. <br>

# Customizing
If you want to run the guessing game from your own images, you can make that possible by changing the images found in "img" directory <br>
and the descriptives found in the "players.csv".
